# Preprocessing

## Description

This module aims at pre-processing pictures and conducting OCR.

Possible pre-processing steps include:

1. Classifying the images (multi-label images VS single-label images)
2. Cropping  multi-label images 
3. Rotating images
4. Detecting background colour?
5. Applying OCR (google vision/pytesseract) on the images



## Structure


#`crop_seg.py` 
is responsible for .



To run the file use the following command:

    `python rotation.py -i input_images -o rotated_images`
 
 Parameters:
 
 -i (input_image_dir): path to the folder with the images
 
 -o (output_image_dir, default = user's current working directory):
  the path to the output folder, where rotated images are saved
  
  

# `rotation.py` 
is responsible for rotating the images.

The angle, the image must be rotated to, is predicted by a pretrained PyTorch model. 
The angle may have the following values: 0째 (predicted that the image's orientation is already correct),
90째, 180째, 270째. 

To run the file use the following command:

    `python rotation.py -i input_images -o rotated_images`
 
 Parameters:
 
 -i (input_image_dir): path to the folder with the images
 
 -o (output_image_dir, default = user's current working directory):
  the path to the output folder, where rotated images are saved
  
  
# `image_classifier.py`

This script is designed to simplify the process of image classification using pre-trained TensorFlow classifier models. 
This script is particularly useful for tasks that involve predicting classes for images and efficiently organizing them based on these predictions.
Executes the `tensorflow_classifier.py` module.

Key Features:

 1. Command-Line Usage: Users can execute the script from the command line with options to specify the classifier model, input image directory, and output directory for saving results.
The command `-h` or `--help` displays a usage message and a list of available command-line options, along with brief explanations for each option.

2. Model Selection: The script supports three pre-defined classifier models, each tailored to a specific classification task. Users can choose the appropriate model for their image classification needs (e.g., distinguishing between 'nuri' and 'not_nuri' (1), 'handwritten' and 'printed' (2), or 'multi' and 'single' labels (3)).

3. Automatic Class Selection: Based on the chosen model, the script automatically selects the class labels associated with that model. This simplifies the process of predicting image classes, as users don't need to manually specify class names.

4. Predictions and Organization:  After parsing command-line arguments and selecting the model and class names, the script proceeds to load the selected model, predict classes for the images in the provided directory, and organize the images into separate directories according to their predicted classes.

5. Customizable Output Directory: Users have the option to specify an output directory for saving both the results (in CSV format) and the classified images. The default output directory is set to the current working directory.
      



To utilize the script, execute it from the command line as follows:


    `python image_classifier.py [-h] -m <model_number> -j <path_to_jpgs> -o <path_to_outputs>`
