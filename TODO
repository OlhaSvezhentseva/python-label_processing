Segmentation:
*DONE*
- add classes argument (for example "1" = class, "2" = box, "3" = handwritten/typed - add to help) *DONE*
- have an other folder "notebooks" for Jupyter notebooks, py files go to "script" folder *DONE*
- Margot: upgrade to python 3.10 *DONE* - the function def get_classtype(class_bool) still doesn't work with Python 3.10 *DONE*
- Add option for location of directory - Not working - correct out_dir directory *DONE*

*TODO*
- add mcOS version of create_crops.py (Margot)
- add option to create directory for each classes - cropping outputs (Leonardo)
- calculate accuracy rate for the australian dataset after segmentation (Margot)


OCR-pytesseract:
*TODO*
- Outputs could be an option (1 just one txt file, 2 one text file per picture, 3 both, 4 one json per picture (5 one big json), 6 pandas dataframe, 7 one xml per file) (Leonardo)
- Do tutorial: https://medium.com/saarthi-ai/how-to-build-your-own-ocr-a5bb91b622ba - create own text detection model with YOLO and Darknet - create training dataset with 100 pictures (Margot)

*DONE*
- run more test on pre-processing of images 

*RESSOURCES*
- find a way to make all the crops straight (better results)!!!!! Priority -> https://pyimagesearch.com/2022/01/31/correcting-text-orientation-with-tesseract-and-python/
  We should check that out
- test to create own OCR model https://keras-ocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/fine_tuning_recognizer.html
