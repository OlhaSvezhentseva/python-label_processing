Collection Mining - Entomological Label Information Extraction
===================================================================

*A Python package for the Berlin Natural History Museum*

.. contents ::

Introduction
------------
This package is a comprehensive solution that seamlessly integrates a range of AI models and functional components, meticulously designed to facilitate the segmentation, classification, rotation, OCR, and clustering of entomology specimen labels. It serves as the foundational framework for the initial steps of information extraction, working in conjunction with the python-mfnb clustering package, which handles clustering in subsequent stages.

Moreover, the installation package includes three specialized TensorFlow classifiers, each thoughtfully adapted to accommodate the distinct styles of input labels. This additional functionality enhances the versatility of the package.

In addition to these core features, our package offers a set of modules, designed to streamline label classification during the segmentation process, optimize image preprocessing before the application of Pytesseract or Google Vision OCR, and refine the postprocessing of OCR outputs to augment the clustering phase.

This comprehensive package allows to efficiently navigate the intricate landscape of entomology label processing while conserving valuable time and resources. It combines precision with versatility, making it an invaluable asset for data processing in the field of entomology.


Installation
------------
1. Create a python environment with python 3.10 (e.g. with conda). On newer python versions some of the dependencies might not work.
   This can be done with conda like this:

   ``conda create --name mfnb python=3.10``

2. Clone python-mfnb from https://code.naturkundemuseum.berlin/collection-mining/label_processing.git .

   ``git clone https://code.naturkundemuseum.berlin/collection-mining/label_processing.git``

3. cd in label_processing-main

   ``cd <path to python-label_processing-main>``
   
4. Install with pip, which will automatically fetch the requirements.

   ``pip install .``

5. If it is intended to use tesseract, it needs to be installed. This can be done via a package manager:
   
   on ubuntu/debian:

   ``sudo apt install tesseract-ocr``

   or on Mac OS:
   
   ``brew install tesseract``


Input preparation
-----------------
**The modules are best to be performed on jpg images of labels from entomology databases such as:**
   
   - `AntWeb`_
   - `Bees&Bytes`_
   - LEP_PHIL - pictures of specimens from the Philippines (by Th√©o Leger)
   - `Atlas of Living Australia`_


**In terms of data acquisition, the following standards are recommended to optimize the outputs:**

- The pictures quality should be standardized and uniform as much as possible, preferably using macro photography, the .jpg format and 300 DPI resolution.
- If there are multiple labels in one picture, they should be clearly separated from one another without overlapping. The text in the label should be aligned horizontally.
- If possible, the specimen shouldn't be present in the picture with the labels.
- If the labels in the different pictures are similar (same colours and/or same nature/content), they should always be placed the same way at the same spot from one picture to another. *ex: label with location always bottom right, collection number top left, taxonomy top right etc...*
- A black background like in LEP_PHIL is prefered, but a white background is also acceptable.

Setting up Google Cloud Vision API and getting credentials
----------------------------------------------------------
- In order to use the google API you need to create a Google account and set it up for Vision.
- How to setup your Google Cloud Vision is explained `on the website`_.
- You need to retrieve your credentials json (everything is explained in the provided link).
- The credentials json file should then be provided as an input in the `vision.py` script.


Installing Pytesseract for MacOS
--------------------------------
Informations about Pytesseract can be found `here`_ or `this website`_.
To install Pytesseract with Homebrew, first install `it`_ and follow the `steps`_.

.. _on the website: https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup
.. _here: https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/
.. _this website: https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html
.. _it: https://brew.sh/
.. _steps: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tesseract


Installing zbar for MacOS and Linux
-----------------------------------
To use the more powerful qr-code reading function of zbar additional dependencies
have to be installed (only for Mac OS and Linux. On Windows they come with the 
Python DLLs) These can be installed via the command line with the following
commands:

Mac OS:

``brew install zbar``

Linux:

``sudo apt-get install libzbar0``
